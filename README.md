# 📊 Simple Profit Calculator (Java)

A clean and efficient starter project designed to practice core programming logic. This tool automates profit calculations for inventory management by processing cost, sales price, and quantity.

## 🚀 Overview
I built this project to master the fundamentals of **Java**, specifically focusing on handling user input and implementing mathematical logic. 

### Key Features:
* **Unit Analysis:** Calculate profit margins for individual pieces.
* **Batch Processing:** Determine the total investment cost and potential revenue for your entire stock.
* **Instant Overview:** Get a clear breakdown of the total net profit from all products combined.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Language:** Java
* **Concepts used:** 
    * `Scanner` class for interactive user input.
    * Arithmetic operators for financial calculations.
    * Data types (utilizing `double` for currency precision).
    * (Optional: if you used them) Loops and Arrays for managing multiple products.

## 📖 Learning Journey
This project helped me understand how to transform real-world business requirements into functional code. It was a great exercise in logic flow and data handling in a statically typed language.
